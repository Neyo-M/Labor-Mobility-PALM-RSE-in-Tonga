There are really 3 key working files that you have here:

1) Main.tex is where the actual editing of the working file is (adding text/tables/graphs etc)
2) Figures folder is where the figures are uploaded to and imported into the .tex file in (1)
3) tau.bib is used to compile all the references throughout the tex file

In final we knit and compile into a pdf which you can view the current status of the pdf above.
